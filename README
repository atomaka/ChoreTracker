As leveling gets easier in World of Warcraft, more and more people are playing more and more alts. And for every alt you add, there are more chores to be done. You have to do your Molten Front dailies on your Hunter, make sure you get your Priest into a Firelands, get that new level 85 Mage into a BWD, and, of course, knock out a Baradin Hold on every 85. Unfortunately, it is incredibly difficult to keep track of all this.

ChoreTracker attempts to solve this problem for you by providing a table of all of your characters with their current Valor Points, Raid Instance locks, and more. Make sure you never miss a Chore again!
